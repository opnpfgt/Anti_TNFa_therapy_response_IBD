# Anti-TNF-_therapy_response_IBD
This repository contains code and data from a study identifying potential transcriptomic biomarkers of response to anti-TNFα therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The research was conducted at the Bioinformatics Institute (2024-2025).

# Introduction
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that significantly reduce the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. Despite sharing key inflammatory mechanisms, UC and CD differ significantly in their clinical and pathological features. During UC, only the mucosal layers of the colon and rectum are affected. In contrast, during CD, any part of the gastrointestinal tract with transmural inflammation can be affected, leading to complications such as fistulas, strictures, and abscesses. 
One of the key immunotherapeutic strategies for IBD treatment is the use of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors, such as infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that blocks the activity of TNF-α. Despite the overall efficacy of TNF-α blockers, many patients do not experience a clinical response to this therapy. This study aims to identify transcriptomic markers associated with treatment response by comparing gene expression profiles in responders and non-responders before anti-TNF-α therapy. These findings may support the development of personalized treatment strategies and improve overall therapeutic outcomes.
